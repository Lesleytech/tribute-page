        <h2>Here are the best of King's quotes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate
            cannot drive out hate; only love can do that".
          </li>
          <li>
            "In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the
            silence of our friends".
          </li>
          <li>
            "The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of
            comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge
            and controversy".
          </li>
          <li>
            "Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that
            matter".
          </li>
          <li>
            "Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be
            demanded by the oppressed".
          </li>
          <li>"The time is always right to do what is right".</li>
          <li>
            "Free at last, Free at last, Thank God almighty we are free at
            last".
          </li>
          <li>
            "Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative
            altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness".
          </li>
          <li>
            "Science investigates; religion interprets. Science gives man
            knowledge, which is power; religion gives man wisdom, which is
            control. Science deals mainly with facts; religion deals mainly with
            values. The two are not rivals".
          </li>
          <li>
            "We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is
            always ripe to do right".
          </li>
          <li>
            "The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and
            to think critically. Intelligence plus character – that is the goal
            of true education".
          </li>
          <li>
            "All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and
            should be undertaken with painstaking excellence".
          </li>
          <li>
            "An individual has not started living until he can rise above the
            narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader
            concerns of all humanity".
          </li>
          <li>
            "Rarely do we find men who willingly engage in hard, solid thinking.
            There is an almost universal quest for easy answers and half-baked
            solutions. Nothing pains some people more than having to think".
          </li>
          <li>
            "Every man lives in two realms: the internal and the external. The
            internal is that realm of spiritual ends expressed in art,
            literature, morals, and religion. The external is that complex of
            devices, techniques, mechanisms, and instrumentalities by means of
            which we live".
          </li>
          <li>
            "Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating
            than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will".
          </li>
          <li>
            "There comes a time when people get tired of being pushed out of the
            glittering sunlight of life’s July and left standing amid the
            piercing chill of an alpine November".
          </li>
          <li>
            “The past is prophetic in that it asserts loudly that wars are poor
            chisels for carving out peaceful tomorrows”.
          </li>
          <li>
            "He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to
            love".
          </li>
          <li>
            "I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the
            final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is
            stronger than evil triumphant".
          </li>
          <li>
            "There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love".
          </li>
          <li>
            "Nonviolence is absolute commitment to the way of love. Love is not
            emotional bash; it is not empty sentimentalism. It is the active
            outpouring of one’s whole being into the being of another".
          </li>
          <li>
            "Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects
            revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method
            is love".
          </li>
          <li>"Let no man pull you so low as to hate him".</li>
          <li>
            "If you can’t fly then run, if you can’t run then walk, if you can’t
            walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving
            forward".
          </li>
        </ul>
